class Critic(nn.Module):
    """
    The critic is responsible for generating dependable Q-values to fit the solution of Bellman Equations. It takes
    a batch of arrays (shaped either (B, 1, N, N) or (N, N)) and a batch of actions (shaped (B, 2)) as input, and
    outputs a tensor shaped (B, ) as the Q-values on the specified (s, a) pairs.

    For example, actions can be:
    [[0, 1],
     [2, 3],
     [5, 6]]
    which means that there are three actions leading the model to place the pieces on the coordinates (0, 1), (2, 3),
    and (5, 6), respectively. These actions correspond one-to-one with indices 0 * 12 + 1 = 1, 2 * 12 + 3 = 27,
    and 5 * 12 + 6 = 66, assuming n to be 12. You can easily transform a single action to the corresponding digit by
    using _position_to_index, or using _index_to_position vice versa.

    The main idea is that we first obtain a tensor shaped (B, N ** 2) as the Q-values for all possible actions given
    the unified state tensor shaped (B, 1, N, N), and then extract the Q-values corresponding to each action (i, j)
    from the entire Q-value tensor. (_position_to_index should be fully utilized to get the corresponding action indices).
    Finally, it returns a tensor of shape (B,) containing these Q-values.
